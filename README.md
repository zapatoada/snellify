# Make-America-Kittens-Again

This is the code for my Chrome extension:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-america-kittens-agai/klchnmggepghlcolikgaekpibclpmgcm

.. that replaces images of Donald Trump with kittens.

Please feel free to copy / edit / reuse the code in any way you like, but please do not use my hosted kitten images - I have to pay the S3 bill each month ;) 

To use your own images, simply edit line 60 of maka.js. Thanks.
