# SNELLIFY

This is the code for my Chrome extension:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/make-america-kittens-agai/klchnmggepghlcolikgaekpibclpmgcm

.. that replaces images of political figures with their SNL counterparts.

Please feel free to copy / edit / reuse the code in any way you like.

To use your own images, simply edit line 60 of maka.js. Thanks.
